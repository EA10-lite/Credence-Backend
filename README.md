# Credence Backend

API and services for the Credence economic trust protocol. Provides health checks, trust score and bond status endpoints (to be wired to Horizon and a reputation engine).

## About

This service is part of [Credence](../README.md). It will support:

- Public query API (trust score, bond status, attestations)
- Horizon listener for bond/slash events (future)
- Reputation engine (off-chain score from bond data) (future)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run locally

**Development (watch mode):**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production:**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

API runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The frontend proxies `/api` to this URL.

## API (current)

| Method | Path               | Description        |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| GET    | `/api/health`      | Health check (readiness + dependency status) |
| GET    | `/api/health/ready`| Readiness (same as `/api/health`) |
| GET    | `/api/health/live` | Liveness (process up; always 200) |
| GET    | `/api/trust/:address` | Trust score (stub) |
| GET    | `/api/bond/:address`   | Bond status (stub) |

### Health endpoint (detailed)

The health API reports status per dependency (database, Redis, optional external) without exposing internal details.

- **Readiness** (`GET /api/health` or `GET /api/health/ready`): Returns `200` when all *configured* critical dependencies (DB, Redis) are up; returns `503` if any critical dependency is down. When `DATABASE_URL` or `REDIS_URL` are not set, those dependencies are reported as `not_configured` and do not cause `503`.
- **Liveness** (`GET /api/health/live`): Returns `200` when the process is running (no dependency checks). Use for Kubernetes/orchestrator liveness probes.

Response shape (readiness):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "credence-backend",
  "dependencies": {
    "db": { "status": "up" },
    "redis": { "status": "up" }
  }
}
```

`status` may be `ok`, `degraded` (optional external down), or `unhealthy` (critical dependency down). Each dependency `status` is `up`, `down`, or `not_configured`. Optional env: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` to enable DB and Redis checks.

### Testing

Health endpoints are covered by unit and route tests. Run:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

Scenarios covered: all dependencies up, DB down (503), Redis down (503), both down (503), only external down (200 degraded), liveness always 200, and no dependencies configured (200 ok).

## Tech

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express

Extend with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Horizon event ingestion when implementing the full architecture.
